## Here is my program to make the perfect Iced Coffee
## The general equation for iced coffee is
#### IcedCoffee = Ice + Coffee + Cream + Flavor + Sugar

print("Hello, Good Morning!")

#Say hello to greet your user

print("How did you sleep last night?")
input()

#You need to put the input after your question so that it is
#interactive and your user can respond.

print("What is on your agenda for today?")
input()

#Now it is time to get into making the perfect coffee

print("Have you had a cup of coffe yet?")
input()

print("Would you like me to help you make the perfect coffee?")
input()

print("Do you prefer hot or iced coffee?")
input()

# Keep asking questions so that they feel involved.
## It also is more of a converstaion which people like
## instead of it just being a computer program.

print("If you like iced coffee add 2 cups of ice into a 24oz tumbler")
print("or if you are feeling fancy add 1 1/2 cups to a glass mason jar.")
print("Now for the important part.")

# Add a little humor

print("Do you need to brew your coffee or do you have cold brew?")
input()

print("If you need to brew your coffee, pop a k-cup into your keurig.")
print("While we wait for that to brew, let's do some trivia.")

### Maybe later down the road, give them an option to skip this part
### but for right now it says.

# Personally I love trivia and it is a great time killer while
# they need to brew their coffee. What trivia is better than
# math trivia?

print("What is 3 * 5?")
input()
print("The answer is ... 15!")

# REMEBER that 4^2 is 16 not 8!!!! 

print("What is 4 ** 2?")
input()
print("The answer is ... 16!")


print("What is 9 / 3")
input()
print("The answer is .... 3")

print("What is 3612 // 2")
input()
print("The answer is ...." , 3612 // 2)


print("What is 3 + 2 - 4?" , end = " ")

## This end will put the answer right at the end of the line and not on a new line.
## This isn't needed but it is kind of different. 

input()
print("The answer is ... 1!")

## This was mainly a way to get all the requirements in
#Now time to wrap it up

print("WAY TO GO!!!!" , " Your coffee should be ready." , sep= " &" )
print("Today is a good day to have a great day.")

## I know that we learned in class today about how to have the question changed on
# a specfic answer, but I am still learning that. So I didn't want to risk it,
# so I just did stuff I was confident in.
